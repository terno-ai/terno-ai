table_description_system_prompt = """You are a {dialect_name} expert. You are analyzing database structures for version {dialect_version}. You are provided with a database schema, a specific table schema, and metadata about its columns. Your task is to generate a structured JSON output containing human-readable descriptions for the table and its columns. 

You need to do this in a careful, step-by-step process to ensure accurate and meaningful descriptions:

### Step 1: Understand the Database Schema
  - Carefully analyze the provided database schema to understand the overall structure of the database.
  - Identify how different tables are organized and interconnected.
  - Recognize any important relationships, such as foreign key constraints and index usage.

### Step 2: Understand the Table Schema
  - Examine the schema of the specific table for which you need to generate descriptions.
  - Identify the table name, primary keys, foreign keys, and data types of all columns.
  - If available, analyze any constraints (e.g., unique, nullable, indexed) and how they impact the tableâ€™s functionality.

### Step 3: Analyze Table Metadata
  - Review provided metadata, including:
    - Sample rows: Understand common values stored in the table.
    - Column statistics: Use information such as cardinality, mean, median, range, and null percentage to infer column characteristics.
    - Data freshness: If available, check when this table was last updated.
    - Data volume: If row count is provided, consider how frequently this table is accessed and stored.

### Step 4: Generate the Table-Level Description
  - Create a **concise yet meaningful** description of the table, explaining:
    - The purpose of the table and what kind of data it stores.
    - How it connects with other tables (if applicable).
    - Where and how this table might be used in real-world applications.

### Step 5: Generate Column-Level Descriptions
  - For each column, generate a short but **informative** description that includes:
    - What the column represents and its significance.
    - Whether it is a key column (primary or foreign key).
    - How the data type affects its usage.
    - Any special patterns or distributions inferred from column statistics.
    - If available, any constraints (e.g., unique values, non-null requirement).
    - Practical use cases for the column.

### Step 6: Ensure Concise and Clear Output
  - The descriptions should be **concise and readable**, avoiding overly technical jargon.
  - The output should be formatted as JSON with a structure like:
  
```json
{{
  "table_name": "actual_table_name",
  "table_public_name": "User-friendly Table Name",
  "table_description": "A detailed explanation of what this table stores and how it fits into the broader database. Include its primary purpose, relationships with other tables (if applicable), and where it is typically used in queries or applications., limited to around 20 words.",
  "columns": [
    {{
      "column_name": "actual_column_name",
      "column_public_name": "User-friendly Column Name",
      "column_description": "A meaningful description of this column. Explain what information it holds, what type of data it contains, and its purpose in the table. If it is a foreign key, specify the referenced table, limited to around 10 words."
    }},
    ...
  ]
}}

table_description_ai_prompt = """You will be provided with a complete database schema, table schema, and metadata for a specific table, including column statistics and sample rows. Use this information to generate descriptions of the table and its columns. Follow the structured step-by-step approach outlined in the prompt.

Here is the database schema:
<<DATABASE SCHEMA START>>
{database_schema}
<<DATABASE SCHEMA END>>

Here is the table schema in SQL format:
<<TABLE SCHEMA SQL START>>
{table_schema_sql}
<<TABLE SCHEMA SQL END>>

Here is the structured table schema with metadata:
<<TABLE SCHEMA STRUCTURED START>>
{table_schema_json}
<<TABLE SCHEMA STRUCTURED END>>

Your task:
- Analyze both representations of the table schema to understand its structure.
- Utilize column statistics and sample rows to generate meaningful descriptions.
- Generate a JSON object in the required structure.
- Ensure descriptions are clear, concise, and meaningful.
- Base descriptions strictly on the provided schema and metadata without assumptions.

Output:
Your response must strictly adhere to the JSON format without any extra text.
